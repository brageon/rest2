<h1 align="center">Reframing Concept</h1>

1. As long as it's not 3-4 pm on Tuesday, it works. # 12 after 5 in noise.
2. When on Tuesday did you have in mind. # 13 after 12 in signal. 
3. **Did you know that vultology is used to see temperament?** 
4. Don't think too much. At the interview I might be a business "HD" with clear goals.
5. At work and/or poker, I'm more focused, sorted. 

Now it's DD (H-last), but if 7,10 then CD. Silly inviting trust beside EXTP with vulnerable F.

1 Of course I don't tell my colleagues straight away as it would be overwhelming.
2 Instead it will be step by step to give 4 skills instead of 16. 
3 Hi Daniel, hope you are well! 
4 How nice that you want to start working as a salesperson with us at Company.
5 I see that you have good experience in the field and therefore I would like to get to know you better over an interview.
6 Is it possible on Tuesday next week, 21/1 2025? All the best!
7 Already have an interview booked for Tuesday. Choose another day next week.
8 My job hunt: 1) world view, 2) profile, 3) lazyapply, 4) if approved, read the ad, 5) vultology, 6) H axis.
9 Been to the swimming pool this morning.
10 Did you know that vultology is used to see temperament
11 Wednesday at 3 pm is a good fit.
12 Don't think too much. At the interview I might be a business "HD" with clear goals
13 Monday also works because he was a "call center". I'm focused on "sales agency"
14 As long as it's not 3-4 pm on Tuesday, it works.
15 When on Tuesday did you have in mind. Sorry that I dominate the conversation.
16 At work and/or poker, I'm more focused, sorted
17 Corrected the ranking with feedback. Sauna before poker.
18 I showed "benefactor" by being nonchalant as there is an asymmetrical balance of power.
19 I make sales as a sales agent for the adrenaline rush.
26 Already have contact with sales manager on LinkedIn.
20 Good at outbound sales but have no product to sell.
25 Tried to make my own SaaS to provide sales training.
21 I rarely look at LinkedIn as people don't interest me.
24 I easily become popular without liking them back.
22 Colleagues like me but I am indifferent to them.
23 People think I'm introvert because of "projection" as I already know they have nothing valuable
